## Key Takeaways

### Design Mindset
- **AI-first thinking**: start from the business problem, then choose the model  
- **Responsible AI**: prioritize safety, compliance, and transparency  
- Build a shared language between engineering, product, and business teams  

### Technical Architecture
- Modern ML workflow: ingest → preprocess → train → deploy → monitor  
- RAG & Agents: how to implement internal chatbots or advisory systems  
- Backend integration patterns with Foundation Models  
- MLOps reduces errors and shortens the development lifecycle  

### Modernization Strategy
- Standardize ML processes using SageMaker  
- Apply Guardrails for safe GenAI deployment  
- Optimize cost by selecting efficient models and automating pipelines  
- Real-world applications: chatbots, content classification, customer support, Q&A systems  

### Applying to Work
- Designing pipelines from data standardization to model monitoring  
- Applying RAG to internal products  
- Building chatbots serving enterprise operations
