### [Blog 1 – Solution for Handling DCA Complaints in the Motor Finance Industry Using AWS Services](3.1-Blog1/)
In the context of scientific research increasingly relying on large-scale computational power, many research institutes and universities face overload issues with their High Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure. Breakthrough projects — especially in fields like genomics, AI/ML, climate modeling, or computational chemistry — are often delayed simply due to a lack of GPU or specialized memory resources.

This article introduces how AWS Cloud Bursting helps eliminate computational bottlenecks by automatically and cost-efficiently extending on-premises HPC clusters to the cloud. This enables research teams to access cutting-edge resources such as the latest NVIDIA GPUs, Trainium, Inferentia, Graviton, or even quantum computing through AWS — exactly when needed.

Through an analysis of current challenges, architecture, real-world examples, and benefits for both researchers and IT teams, the article provides a comprehensive view of how Cloud Bursting is shaping the future of research computing. It represents an inevitable trend that preserves research momentum and ensures groundbreaking ideas are not constrained by infrastructure limitations.

### [Blog 2 – Research at the Speed of Discovery: AWS Cloud Bursting Eliminates Compute Bottlenecks](3.2-Blog2/)
This article explores how AWS Cloud Bursting is transforming the way research institutions and universities handle massive computational workloads in modern science. As breakthroughs in genomics, AI/ML, climate simulation, or computational chemistry increasingly demand powerful and flexible GPU resources, traditional HPC infrastructure often fails to keep up, leading to long wait times and slow research progress.

AWS Cloud Bursting delivers a powerful solution: extending on-premises HPC clusters to the cloud automatically and cost-effectively, allowing research teams to instantly access next-generation GPUs, specialized AI processors, high-performance file systems, and even quantum computing.

The article analyzes current challenges, how HPC bursting works, real-world benefits, and why this strategy is becoming essential for maintaining innovation speed in scientific research.

### [Blog 3 – AWS Transform for .NET Now Supports Q&A for Assessment and Transformation Reports](3.3-Blog3/)
This article introduces a new feature in AWS Transform for .NET that makes modernizing .NET applications faster and more intuitive. Instead of manually reading through long and complex assessment and transformation reports, users can now ask questions directly in natural language using the integrated chat interface in the web console.

The Q&A feature helps development teams quickly extract critical information about repositories, complexity levels, transformation changes, and upgraded packages — without manually parsing each report.

This marks an important step forward in automating and simplifying large-scale .NET modernization, particularly for organizations working with many repositories in major transformation projects.
