During my internship at **FCJ (First Cloud Journey) AWS** from **08/09/2025** to **09/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge gained from school in a real working environment.  
I participated in events and worked on projects using AWS services, which helped me improve my analytical skills, communication, technical knowledge, and reporting abilities.

In terms of work attitude, I always tried to complete tasks well, follow company rules, and actively communicate with colleagues to enhance work efficiency.

To objectively reflect my internship performance, I would like to provide a self-evaluation based on the criteria below:
